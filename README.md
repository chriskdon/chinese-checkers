gradle connectedCheck

These are the rules that all game logic will be based off of: http://www.mastersgames.com/rules/chinese-checkers-rules.htm

**Alternative for people who can't get Android Studio/Eclipse Working**

You can build the project from terminal using gradle.
  - [Tutorial](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide#TOC-Build-Tasks)
  - Build: $ gradle build
  - Install: $ gradle installDebug
  - Run: $ adb shell am start -n yourpackagename/.activityname


**Software Used**
  - Android Studio for Android application creation.
  - Photoshop/Illustrator for design files.
  - OmniGraffle 6 (Mac) for UML/Diagramming
    - I'll try and export the diagrams to PDF as we need them.
    - But if you have a Mac you can open the .graffle file with OmniGraffle to see the non exported components.

*Update via AndroidStudio GitHub plugin
